description: 'Below is a partial list of the software I worked on over the last few years. Clearly, this software is not perfect, but each project taught me something new, and I like to think that I got better over time. Feedback is greatly appreciated. If you find a bug, please open an issue in the relevant repository.<br><br>Feel free to visit my [GitHub account](https://github.com/enweg) for more projects not listed here.'
